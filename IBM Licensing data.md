How does IBM approach the resolution of compliance findings?

Where non-compliance with licensing terms is identified, IBM will work with clients to resolve this.
Resolution will require the purchase of licenses sufficient to cover any excess usage and Subscription and Support for those additional licenses for the lesser of two years or the duration of the excess use.

Why does IBM have a compliance program?

We expect our clients to pay correctly for their use of IBM technologies. Because our licensing is based on trust, we need to check from time to time that we are receiving that fair reward. Similarly, our clients expect a level playing field and that some clients are not unfairly advantaged by circumventing our licensing terms.
Checking clients' compliance is how we strive to be fair.

What are my license entitlements?

Your license entitlements are comprised of one or more Proofs of Entitlement (PoE). They are a record of the IBM products for which you have purchased licenses and the level of use permitted. For each IBM product you purchase, you will receive a Proof of Entitlement specifying the level of authorized use for that product. You can view and manage your entitlements via Passport Advantage Online (“PA Online”)
You can also read more about entitlements here and refer to the user guide 'How to understand your entitlement position using PA Online' on the Guides page.

Why do some of my contracts or Site Numbers appear to be missing from PA Online?

PA Online may not reflect licenses procured via means that do not result in those Proof of Entitlements being recorded by IBM. In addition, certain events that may take place, such as those in an M&A context, which might result in licenses being transferred between organizations. PA Online will not reflect this until IBM has been provided adequate details of the change and has approved the change.

How do I stay in compliance with the IBM licensing terms?

IBM encourages clients to better understand and manage their IBM software use, and it is ultimately the client’s responsibility to do so. The client is contractually obliged to create and maintain records of its use of IBM software.
The user guide on 'Preparing for an IBM audit' on the Guides page provides guidance on how to assess your compliance with IBM's licensing terms.

Can IBM confirm the licenses required in respect of a particular actual or proposed deployment configuration?

We encourage clients to approach us with questions relating to maintaining compliance with our licensing terms. However, as IT estates inevitably change and not all details may be provided at the time of asking, the responsibility to remain compliant rests with the client.

Why can’t IBM warn clients of overdeployment so as to ensure compliance?

IBM holds records of what we have sold to clients, but we do not have information on what the client has actually deployed. In other words, IBM has no information about how many licenses are being used and must trust clients to stay within the limits they have paid for. An audit, or other form of licensing verification activity, confirms that a client is compliant.

Why have I been nominated for audit?

Clients should expect to be audited every three to four years. Time since the last audit is the most common criteria for audit nomination.

Am I obliged to accept the audit?

Yes. The agreements in place between IBM and clients give IBM the right to verify clients' adherence to the terms and conditions set out in the contracts, transaction documents and IBM software licensing policies. While IBM and the appointed auditors will make every effort to minimize the amount of time required, clients are expected to cooperate with the audit.

Who bears the costs of the audit?

IBM covers the full cost of the audit process which is run by our trusted audit partners. While there is no direct cost for our clients, we recognize that this creates additional unscheduled work for them which can be time and resource consuming. We aim, therefore, for the audit process to be efficient with minimal disruption.
We do not pay for outsourcers' or service provider's time, or internally cross-charged expenses that a client incurs to comply with our right to verify compliance with our licensing terms.

How long is an audit expected to last?

A typical audit takes approximately two to three months from the kick-off meeting to the production of the final report. However, the time can vary significantly according to the size and complexity of the IBM deployments, the client organization, and the level of cooperation received. IBM and the appointed auditors make every effort to minimize the amount of time required to conclude the audit.

Can I select my own auditor?

Normally audits are run by a third-party auditor on IBM’s behalf, with the costs fully covered by IBM. The IBM audit partners have significant expertise in software licensing and experience in running this process efficiently to ensure as little disturbance as possible to a client's normal day-to-day operations. IBM selects the auditor and expects that the client will cooperate with the auditor's requests. In exceptional circumstances the client may request that the audit is conducted by another third-party provider normally used by IBM. This is subject to IBM's agreement.

Will the audit require an on-site visit?

Much of the audit process can now be conducted remotely and many audits are done entirely remotely. The extent of any on-site visits required will be agreed between the auditor and the client in the early planning stages of the audit.

Will IBM/audit partner provide an indemnity if they expect me to run their scripts?

Neither IBM nor its audit partners are able to offer an indemnity. It is the client's responsibility to have created and maintained records of their use of IBM software sufficient to demonstrate that they have complied with the license terms. This is set out in the IPLA ('Verification Process').
If an audit partner is requesting the client to run data collection tools this is often due to the client not having complied with their obligations to have these records available for inspection. The tools are offered as a more efficient alternative to gathering data than doing so manually, and our audit partners will always give time for any tools to be inspected and put through change control procedures.

Why does IBM/audit partner want to see information from machines that don’t have IBM software on them?

The two key qualities of an audit report are completeness and accuracy. An audit report which fails to achieve either of these objectives is of limited value to both IBM and the client.
To determine completeness, the auditor will need to inspect machines where it is expected that no IBM software is deployed to verify that this is in fact the case. Details of these machines and the software installed on them is not provided to IBM; it is used for the auditor's own validation of completeness.

If I come forward with known licensing issues before the audit report is issued, will I get more favorable settlement terms?

While each situation is reviewed on a case-by-case basis, IBM is committed to a non-punitive approach to resolving any non-compliance matters with its clients.

Can I appeal against the audit findings? Who should I appeal to within IBM?

The Worldwide Head of Software Compliance is the final arbiter within IBM on any matter relating to license compliance.

Are all Passport Advantage clients subject to audit?

IBM regularly reviews its clients' software consumption and adherence to terms in the licensing agreement. All Passport Advantage clients have agreed to terms that provide IBM with a right to audit.

Where in my contract does it say I am required to track the consumption of IBM software?

For all Programs at all Sites and for all environments, Client annually will: i) provide a report of deployed Programs, in a format, equivalent to the reporting template under License Verification annual reporting, or as otherwise requested by IBM, using records, system tools output, and other system information; ii) provide supporting documentation (collectively, Deployment Data); and iii) retain this information for a minimum of 2 years. Upon request from IBM, Client will provide this information within 30 days of the request.
The equivalent term for Passport Advantage Express (PAE) clients is in the International Passport Advantage Express Agreement (IPAEA).
The International Program License Agreement (IPLA) includes this requirement.
The IBM Customer Agreement (ICA) includes this requirement.
The Client Relationship Agreement (CRA) includes this requirement.

What information am I obliged to supply to IBM on request?

In the context of an audit you must provide the accurate written records, system tool outputs and other system information sufficient to provide auditable verification of your use of all IBM programs is in compliance with the relevant agreements.
Certain licensing policies also require information to be regularly gathered and either provided to IBM or retained and provided to IBM or its auditor upon request. For example, reports must be regularly created from Virtualization Capacity metering tools such as ILMT and IBM License Service and retained. In addition, the IASP Program requires periodic reporting to IBM in order to remain an active participant.
